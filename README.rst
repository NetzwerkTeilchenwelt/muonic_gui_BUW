This package is an optional dependency for the muonic package. It provides the GUI consumer that can be registered with the '-G' option when using the core lib. 

Notice that this overrides any measurement type flag. 

This package is well integrated with the muonic_mysql package. 

Different measurements started from the GUI will be condensed into one run in the muonic_django run database when the -D option is also set.
